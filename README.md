#Potionographer — README

## Overview
Potionographer is a Unity game inspired by the “Papa’s Pizzeria” style of gameplay — but with a magical twist.
Instead of cooking meals, players mix magical potions for quirky customers who arrive with unusual dilemmas. The goal is to understand each customer’s problem, select the correct magical ingredients, and craft the right potion before the day ends.
The project is being developed for a class assignment and currently includes 3 days of progression, increasing customer difficulty, and a win/lose condition at the end of Day 3.

## Features
### Multiple Rooms (Single Scene)
- Order Room:
Customers appear, present their problem, and highlight keywords hinting at required potion ingredients.
- Cauldron Room:
Players drag-and-drop ingredients into a cauldron to mix each potion.
### Ingredient-Based Puzzle Gameplay
- Players must pick correct ingredients based on customer dialogue.
- Mistakes cause angry dialogue or potential game over after repeated failures.
### Progression System
3 in-game “days”
Each day introduces:
- more customers
- more ingredients
- more complex orders
### Future Expansion Ideas (Post-Class)
- Player customization
- More days
- More ingredients
- Character unlocks
- Dialogue audio or stylized voice fonts
